# Perfboard-Built-Oscilloscope-with-Multi-Parameter-Signal-Analysis
Built an oscilloscope circuit on a perforated PCB using analog components like resistors, capacitors, and an oscillator. Measures signals from 0–10 kHz with ±2 Hz accuracy, displaying duty cycle and peak voltage up to 12V.Includes Hold, Up, and Down buttons for waveform freeze and real-time navigation.
